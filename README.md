# Active-RAG-survey
Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated revolutionary capabilities in language understand-ing and generation, but still face limitations such as illusions and outdated internal knowledge. Retriev-al-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques have been shown to be effective in integrating the latest information in LLMs, reducing hallucinations and improving the quality of responses. However, it is not appropriate to face all LLM application sce-narios in a origin RAG manner, and how to decide when and how to conduct RAG is an urgent problem.  In response to the problem of "When & How to RAG", a series of work has been proposed, often referred as "Active/Adaptive/Dynamic RAG", which is collectively referred to as Active RAG in this paper. This survey provides the first in-depth ex-ploration of Active RAG and a detailed taxonomy of various methods, presents existing data sets and task performance, and discusses the challenges and future opportunities in this emerging field.
